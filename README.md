### Wikiparser
Parses Wikipedia dumps into TeXoo.

#### How to run it
```console
make all
```

If you require a specific dump, download it from from [Wikipedia](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/). This parser is only compatible with `pages-articles` dumps. Make sure that only one dump is in the project folder.
